# Hello-World
Hi all. Retired audio/video sysstems engineer exploring more sophisticated setups for video and audio editing, production, streaming from my desktop computer.
I am an advanced Win10 user and light/beginning programmer. Experienced in design and programming of major hardware audio DSP systems like Biamp Tesira and control GUI's for them.
Currently trying to implement Jack Router, but Win installer doesn't work. 
Personal project is to chase lock Lighworks NLE to Harrison Mixbus DAW via LTC linear timecode link for real time cross application transport control and editing capabilities.
